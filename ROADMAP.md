###Roadmap

This is our small and short, ground-breaking todo list for the application.

<ol>
	<li>Embed a (reactified) ready-to-use editor into contentEditable section. We need that one since we should represent a content of the selected file content formatted.</li>
	<li>Integrate a tree component for left section of the app. It would be nice to have this feature for a better user/developer experience.</li>
	<li>Add file interactions like saving and etc.</li>
	<li>Create npm package of the app to be used as a global application. We need the app to run like the following:</li>
</ol>

```javascript
npm i ziya -g
```
